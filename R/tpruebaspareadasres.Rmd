## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
contenido <- c(510, 492, 494, 498, 492,
               496, 502, 491, 507, 496)
content <- c(15, 30, 50, 60,	25,	65,	45,	90,	50,	15, 65,	56,	45,	32,	75,	52,	85,	78,	20,	35, 70,	75,	45,	45,	52,	17,	80,	20,	75,	50, 55)
t.test(contenido, alternative='two.sided',
       conf.level=0.95, mu=500)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
